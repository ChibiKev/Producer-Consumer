## Producer-Consumer
Project for CSC 332 - Operating Systems with Professor Zaid Al-Mashhadni at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- Create a multithread program consisting of one producer (random times) and two consumers.
- A producer produces a product and stops after 50 products are completed.
- Each consumer consumes a product if any exists.
- Consumers should compete for products
- Each consumer obtains a fair number of products (Peterson Algorithm)
- Producer and consumers run concurrently
- Print each step and the number of products consumed by the consumer.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
